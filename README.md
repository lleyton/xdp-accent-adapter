# xdp-accent-adapter

Adapt the DE's preferred accent color (provided via XDP) for ~~legacy~~ platforms not supporting the standard. Just a fun side-project.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Obligatory disclaimer because some of you have an IQ below room temperature. This daemon themes applications in unsupported ways. While your applications probably won't break, take responsibility if they do. Do not open issues with applications, toolkits, or platforms until you disable the daemon and cleanup files the daemon modified. No one needs that.

## 🚀 Getting Started

TODO (contributions welcome)

## 🗒️ Todos

- Documentation.
- Snapping to the backend platform's color palette if an option is set.
- Don't completely hijack the user's gtk.css files if there's content in there.
- Option to cleanup/reset files touched by the backend modules.
- More backends?
